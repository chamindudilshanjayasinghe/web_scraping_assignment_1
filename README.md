# Lab 1 – Web Scraping (Data Collection & Quality)

This project is my submission for **Lab 1 – Web Scraping** (Course: AMI23K).  
The lab demonstrates how to ethically collect data from online resources using Python.  
It includes scraping **textual data, market data, and weather data**, then saving them into appropriate file formats.
